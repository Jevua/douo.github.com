Do we desugar to a static method or instance method?  

In what class should the desugared method go?

If adaptations are required to bridge differences between the lambda body signature and the functional interface method signature (such as boxing, unboxing, primitive widening or narrowing conversions, varargs conversions, etc), should the desugared method follow the signature of the lambda body, the functional interface method, or something in between? Who is responsible for the needed adaptations?
If the lambda captures arguments from the enclosing scope, how should those be represented in the desugared method signature? (They could be individual arguments added to the beginning or end of the argument list, or the compiler could collect them into a single "frame" argument.)



The compiler will infer a method signature for the lambda expression, including **argument types, return type, and thrown exceptions**; we will call this the natural signature


Consumer<T>{
   public apply(T t) // object  lambda descriptor
}

Consumer<String> s = (arg) -> sout(arg)

natural signature : (String)void
lambda descriptor: (Object)void
