Have you ever noticed that in Java many interface names (Appendable, Adjustable, Activatable, Callable, Cloneable, Closeable, and many more) end with “-able”?. That’s because they refer to an ability.

An object may have many abilities and so its class may implement many interfaces, but reusing implementations of any such ability is restricted to only one superclass.
